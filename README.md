NGinn.BPM
=========

NGinn.BPM is a workflow engine for Microsoft.Net. It utilizes Petri nets for modelling process logic and a process description language somewhat similar to BPMN.

The main design objectives of this project are:
*   Ligtweight
    Easy to embed in any kind of application, without too many external dependencies, bloat controlled tightly
*   Transactional, bulletproof
    ACID properties for long running processes (data durability, atomic updates, consistency in case of failures, general reliability and robustness)
*   Expressive like BPMN
    One of goals here is full BPMN support, but we concentrate on process definitions being concise, human-readable and human-authorable (without using code generators)
*   Powerful
    So it can take care of many aspects of application logic.
*   Performant
    We pay great attention to I/O and memory efficiency of the engine
